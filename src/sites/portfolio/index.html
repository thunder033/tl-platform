        <p>
            I am a full stack engineer with combined freelance, project, and professional experience of over 8 years.
            I have worked on systems ranging from a humble college library catalog,
            to backend services powering one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S.,
            to an industrial-grade big-data platform.
            I strive to apply cutting edge technology to tackle society's most pressing issues.

            Growing up in the Cleveland, OH suburb of Sheffield Village, I dove into web development when I was 10.
            I began freelancing as I entered high school, a gig that propelled me to an accelerated completion of my
            B.S. in Game Design &amp; Development from Rochester Institute of Technology.
